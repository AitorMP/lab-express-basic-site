    <h1>Storm Trooper J344Y</h1>
    <h2>AKA: Jerry</h2>
    <p>
      Jerry joined the empire at the sweet age of 21. He wanted to become
      stormtrooper to be able to see world's beyond his own
    </p>
    <p>
      In the academy Jerry realised he wasn't the brightest bulb in the box.
      But, what he lacked in brain matter he compansate with effort and
      sheerless power of will
    </p>
    <p>
      During one of his assigments Jerry met AWOADKL (Wendy for short). They
      fell in love, bought a tiny shack in a very sandy planet called Tattoine
      *real estate is a joke* and had two beautiful Predator looking kids. Tommy
      and Saphire
    </p>
    <p>
      His family are now in a Gallatic witness protection program due to the
      crimes of the Empire and being Jerry part of it
